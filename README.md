## Overview

The challenge helped me learn to work with JSON, fetch API, async-await, grid, and flexbox. These are the things I used in the challenge, most of them are used in the previous challenge by the frontend mentor and got a chance to familiarize those. Because the design is a little tricky and includes a lot of elements the challenge was really helpful to learn to place the elements and a lot of layout practices.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Fetch API
- JSON

### Continued development

The main area that I want to focus on as the previous challenge from the frontend mentor is accessibility and another area I keep on struggling or not focusing on where I need more push is how to structure the document properly so we don't need to rearrange it while writing CSS which cause more re-writing codes as well as time.
